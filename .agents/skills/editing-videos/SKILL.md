# Editing videos

Taste for editing, written down so an agent can follow it with any editor: Final Cut Pro,
Premiere, Resolve, CapCut, ffmpeg, Remotion, HyperFrames or JCSS.

## How to use it

1. Read [EDITING.md](EDITING.md) in full. It is the guide; this file only says how to apply it.
2. Read the whole transcript, the brief and any notes. If there's no transcript, make one with
   word timings first, with what's already here (the editor's own, or a local Whisper). Use an
   online transcription service only if it's already set up; if nothing can transcribe, say so
   and ask for a transcript.
   Throughout, use only services already set up (EDITING.md, "Work with what's set up").
3. Write your read of the video (EDITING.md §1) and ask the person what you need to know. When
   you can't ask, go with your best read and say what you assumed.
4. Edit in this order: retakes and mistakes, then cuts between phrases, then the shape (the
   opening, chapters, the ending), then B-roll and graphics, then captions and titles, then
   sound.
5. Check it (§8) before you say it's done, and turn the person's notes into rules (§9).

For a small, specific request, skip to the part of the guide it touches.

## With JCSS

[JCSS](https://jcss.tv) is a studio for recording and streaming. Every live decision
(cuts, zooms, titles, chapters) is saved as an edit, so the video is mostly done when you stop
recording. Its edits are plain JSON files that agents change through its MCP server and `jcss`
CLI, and it follows this guide itself:

- Every camera and screen is recorded on its own, so B-roll and cutaways start from your own
  angles.
- Transcripts are made while you record (on a capable Mac), with retakes, fillers and long
  pauses already found as cuts you can switch on and off.
- Agents check their work: `jcss_edit_frame` and stills either side of a cut, `jcss_edit_loudness`
  against the export's target.
- Every change is a version you keep or undo.

It edits videos you didn't record in it, too. With JCSS installed (its `jcss` CLI is inside the
app: `/Applications/JCSS.app/Contents/Helpers/jcss` on a Mac):

```sh
jcss edit from-video ~/Movies/talk.mov -p ~/Movies/Talk   # makes a show there if there isn't one
```

That opens the video as an edit and, with JCSS open, transcribes it on your computer. Then edit
it with this guide through `jcss edit …` or the MCP server (`claude mcp add --scope user jcss --
<path-to-jcss> mcp`, tool `jcss_edit_from_video`), and open the show in JCSS to watch the edit,
keep or undo each change and export it (MP4, or a Final Cut, Premiere or Resolve timeline).
`jcss_guide` (or `jcss guide`) says everything else it can do.
